# SimNPCs

This package is a pretty messy collection of different ideas that I had for simulating NPC careers, experience, interactions, etc.

I'm not happy how it is implemented but I decided to publish the code so others can take inspiration or maybe suggest improvements. There are a few problems with the code like for example the lack of separation of the different logical parts of the code and whatnot.
