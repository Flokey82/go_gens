# Simple behavior tree in Golang (WIP)
This is a very, very behavior tree that does the basic basics. It's not meant to be used in production, but it is probably good for tinkering around and learning how those things behave and whatnot.

## Principle
I'll write something here some day when this is done.

## IOU
Proper documentation whenever this is finished.
