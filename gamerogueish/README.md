# Gamerogueish

This is a sorta-kinda roguelike using the fantastic package https://github.com/BigJk/ramen, which is a simple console emulator written in go that can be used to create various ascii / text (roguelike) games.

Right now, the code is a really basic re-factor of the roguelike example that comes with Ramen, but I'll use it as a basis for various (at least to me) interesting experiments :)
