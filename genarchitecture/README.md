- [ ] Vernacular architecture
    - [ ] Add climate aspects, insulation of materials, etc.
- [ ] Mesh/building generation
    - [ ] Design a "recipe" concept for generating buildings
        - [X] Basic functionality
        - [ ] Refine rules
    - [ ] Implement some sample recipes
        - [X] Simple cathedral
