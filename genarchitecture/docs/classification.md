This book describes vernacular architecture in the UK, but the concepts are applicable to other regions as well.

I will expand on this in the future, but for now I will just transcribe the relevant parts from the book.

# Classification of vernacular architecture

Example list of architectural elements:

a: walling material, shape, coursing, jointing, finish
b: roofing shape
c: detail at verge
d: detail at eaves
e: material, method of laying
f: ridge
g: chimney position
h: water tabling, etc
i: dormers, position, shape, roofing, walling material
j: plan form
k: sectional form
l: staircase provision
m: window shape
n: window frames
o: door shape
p: door details
q: relasionship between farm buildings and farm-house
r: use of farm buildings
