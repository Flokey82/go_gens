// Vernacular architecture is the type of architecture that is developed by a community
// or a culture. It is not designed by architects, but by the people who live in the
// buildings. It is often the result of a long process of evolution and adaptation to
// the local climate, culture, and materials. It is often the result of a long process
// of evolution and adaptation to the local climate, culture, and materials.
//
// Climate
//
// The climate is a very important factor in vernacular architecture.
// - Temperature range (extremes and average)
// - Wind speed and direction
// - Precipitation

// 1. Hot and arid climate:
// See: https://thedesigngesture.com/housing-in-extreme-heat/
//
// Main strategies:
// - Thick walls made of local materials such as adobe, mud brick, or stone, which provide thermal mass to keep the interior cool during the day and retain heat at night.
// - Light-coloured materials that reflect solar radiation
// - Horizontal cross ventilation and vertical airflow, also known as the stalk effect, help with thermal comfort.
// - A courtyard or central open space that provides shade and promotes natural ventilation.
// - Small windows or openings with wooden shutters or louvers to allow for air circulation while keeping out the harsh sun.
// - Flat roofs that are often used as outdoor living spaces in the evening when temperatures cool down.
// - Having open plans enables ventilation.
// - Roof vents and ceiling fans help.
// - Having fans or vents in the washrooms helps in exhausting moisture.
//
// NOTES:
//
// Paint and Wood
// Excess heat causes paint to bubble up. The exterior finish of houses gets chipped and becomes flaky.
// This causes moisture and mold in the house because of openings created. Elastomeric paint creates a
// barrier against heat and moisture. Trying to paint on surfaces at a higher temperature can be a little
// tricky. The heat causes the paint to become thinner, dries faster than it should, and leads to a wrinkly
// and bumpy finish. Too much heat causes wood to shrink or swell. It dries out, cracks, peels, and expands
// because of heat.
//
// Roofs in Extreme Heat
// Roofs face direct sunlight at the top. Proper ventilation in the attic area ensures that there is no
// excess humidity in the attic area, which prevents deterioration of shingles. Heat results in warping,
// expansion, cracks, leakage, and drying. Installation of vapor barriers, and coating the roof to seal
// against UV rays’ help.
//
// Sand storms
// Protection against sand storms is of utmost importance when designing buildings in such a climate.
// Settlements are preferred to be as compact as possible and present spatial geometry. Orienting them
// in huge clusters enables the buildings to act as shading devices for the roads and other houses. This
// kind of planning reduces the surfaces area exposed to sun radiation.
//
// Wind catchers and courtyards
// Across the middle-east, elements include design features such as courtyard gardens with water features,
// screen walls, reflected light, mashrabiya (the distinctive oriel window with timber lattice-work) and
// bad girs (wind-catchers).

// 2. Hot and humid climate:
// See: https://www.connectionsbyfinsa.com/architecture-in-extreme-climates-humidity/?lang=en
//
// Main strategies:
// - Be as lightweight as possible and provide lots of ventilation as well as protection from the sun without using thermal inertia.
// - High-pitched roofs that allow hot air to rise and escape through vents, promoting air circulation and cooling the interior.
// - Overhanging eaves and verandas that provide shade and protection from the rain.
// - Raised floors to prevent flooding and promote air circulation.
//   The house will be exposed to breezes, in addition to being protected from floods as well as insects and other animals.
// - Cross-ventilation: This might be the most important aspect of architecture for these climates.
//   Lots of ventilation is needed to cool the air which is why walls are removed whenever possible and replaced by moving panels,
//   low walls, Venetian blinds or slatted elements that separate indoor and outdoor spaces.
//   Large apertures in opposing walls are also used to make sure the air can flow without any obstacles.
// - Light and breathable materials such as bamboo, thatch, or wood that allow for ventilation.
// - The roof should be lightweight to avoid trapping heat and consist of at least two superimposed layers with a ventilated air chamber between them.
//   This is perhaps the most important structural element: it’s both a sunshade and an umbrella.
//   Roofs in these locations are usually conical or pyramidal.
//
// NOTES:
//
// Roofs in Extreme Humidity
// Roofs in extreme humidity are prone to mold and mildew. The roof should be made of materials that
// are resistant to moisture, dry quickly, and do not retain moisture.
//
// Colour
// The lighter the colour, the better, as it will reflect the sun’s rays more. You can choose from tropical shades, natural timber, sand, and of course, white.
//
// Protection from the sun
// Solar radiation, both direct and diffuse, should be avoided at all costs. This can be achieved with orientation as well as trees and other vegetation.
// There’s also the option of window coverings such as latticework, curtains, or Persian blinds, as well as painting the roof white.
// These approaches darken the large apertures in the home and reduce the amount of light and heat entering the space.
// Eaves and cantilevers can also be installed on the lower part of the roof to divert rainwater and provide shade outdoors,
// making them open galleries where we can rest and do activities while remaining protected from the sun and the rain.

// 3. Cold climates:
// See: https://www.connectionsbyfinsa.com/architecture-in-extreme-climates-icy/?lang=en
//
// Main strategies:
// - Thermal insulation and energy conservation
// 	- High thermal mass or significant amounts of insulation
//  - Thick walls made of local materials such as stone or brick, with insulation such as straw, mud, or animal hair to retain heat.
// 	- Sealed in order to prevent heat loss
// 	- Dark colours that attract solar radiation.
// 	- The use of materials that warm up slowly for the interiors
// 	- The use of wood for both walls and interiors.
// 	- Compact buildings with low form factors, including underground or semi-underground structures
//    that take advantage of the thermal inertia of the earth around them which reduces temperature
// 	  fluctuations.
//	- Roofing with plants as insulation.
//    Turf houses in Iceland are an example of how this strategy is used in traditional architecture.
//  - Small recesses
// - Ventilation to eliminate excess humidity
//	- Openings such as windows tend to be small or even absent altogether
// 	- Ventilation via chimneys.
// - Small windows and openings that reduce heat loss while providing natural light and ventilation.
// - Sloped roofs that prevent snow buildup and allow for drainage.
// - Gable roofs so that snow slides off easily.
// - Fireplaces or stoves that provide heat and serve as a gathering place for the family.
//
// NOTES:
//
// Which materials should be used?
// The choice of materials will have a huge impact on thermal insulation.  With the right materials, the house will be able to withstand extreme weather and will last longer.  Recommendations for icy climates include:
//
// Teak wood: a type of flexible yet durable wood thanks to the high content of oils and natural rubbers
// Plaster: a material that has bene used for cladding, floors, and dividing walls since ancient Egypt.
// Limestone: the main raw material used to make cement.

// 4. Continental climate:
// Continental climate is similar to the Mediterranean climate, but with more extreme temperature changes throughout the year.
// Buildings might be altered by their occupants according to the seasons (Using stored hay for livestock as additional insulation,
// closing or sealing windows and doors, etc.)
//
// Main strategies:
// - Buildings for a continental climate must be able to cope with significant variations in temperature,
//   and may even be altered by their occupants according to the seasons.
// - Adequate insulation in walls, floors, and roofs to retain heat in the winter and keep the interior cool in the summer.
//   This might be straw, grass, and/or clay.
//   Wood is a good insulator and easy to source locally as primary material.
// - Large windows and openings that allow for natural ventilation and capture sunlight in the winter.
// - Overhanging eaves that provide shade in the summer and allow sunlight to penetrate in the winter.
// - Materials such as adobe, stone or brick that are durable and locally sourced and provide high thermal mass.
// - Compact buildings with low form factors, including underground or semi-underground structures
//   that take advantage of the thermal inertia of the earth around them which reduces temperature
//   fluctuations.
// - Pitched roofs with steep angles are often used to facilitate snow shedding.
//
// TODO: Investigate this further.

// 5. Temperate climate:
// Temperate climates are characterized by moderate temperatures and precipitation throughout the year.
// Buildings in temperate climates are designed to be comfortable in all seasons.
//
// Main strategies:
// - Similar to continental climates, but with less extreme temperature changes throughout the year.
// - Walls may be thinner than in other climates, but still need to be thick enough to provide thermal mass.

// 6. Mediterranean climate:
// Mediterranean climates are characterized by hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters.
// Buildings in Mediterranean climates are designed to be comfortable in all seasons.
//
// Main strategies:
// - Similar to continental climates, but with less extreme temperature changes throughout the year.
// - Walls may be thinner than in other climates, but still need to be thick enough to provide thermal mass.
// - Buildings should be compact and low to the ground.
// - Roofs should be flat or low-pitched to provide shade and collect rainwater for irrigation.
//
// Building materials
// The use of local, durable, and natural materials is common in vernacular architecture in Mediterranean
// climates. Examples include stone, clay, adobe, and wood.
//
// Roof design:
// The design of the roof is important to provide shade and protection from the sun. Flat or low-pitched
// roofs with overhanging eaves are commonly used to provide shade and to collect rainwater for use in
// irrigation.
//
// Courtyards:
// Courtyards are a common feature of vernacular architecture in Mediterranean climates, as they provide
// a cool, shaded outdoor living space. They can also help to regulate indoor temperature by creating a
// microclimate that is cooler than the surrounding area.
//
// Windows and ventilation:
// Natural ventilation is crucial in Mediterranean climates to reduce indoor temperature and improve
// air quality. Windows and doors are strategically placed to allow for cross-ventilation and to maximize
// natural light.
//
// Water management:
// Water is a precious resource in Mediterranean climates, and vernacular architecture often includes
// features for water collection, storage, and reuse. Rainwater collection systems, cisterns, and wells
// are commonly used to collect and store water for use in irrigation and household needs.

// Appendix A: Strong winds
//
// Main strategies:
// - Buildings in windy climates should be designed to withstand strong winds.
// - Buildings should be compact and low to the ground.
// - Roofs should be flat or low-pitched to prevent wind from lifting them off.

// Appendix B: Seismic activity
//
// Main strategies:
// - Buildings in seismic areas should be designed to withstand earthquakes.
// - Buildings should be compact and low to the ground and use flexible materials
//   such as adobe, straw, or wood.
