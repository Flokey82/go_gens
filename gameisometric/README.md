# gameisometric

This is a simple isometric 'game' experiment using the ebitengine and is written in Go.
The code is heavily inspired by the [ebiten isometric example](https://ebitengine.org/en/examples/isometric.html). I modified the code to use [gendungeon](https://github.com/Flokey82/go_gens/gendungeon) for level generation instead of just randomly place tiles.

## NOTE

Part of (or All) the graphic tiles used in this program is the public domain roguelike tileset 'RLTiles'.
You can find the original tileset at: http://rltiles.sf.net
