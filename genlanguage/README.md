# genlanguage: Fantasy language generator

This is a wrapper for "github.com/Flokey82/naming-language-gen/naming" which is a fork of https://github.com/asmaloney/naming-language-gen.

The main use case is the generation of various languages and culture specific words in https://github.com/Flokey82/genworldvoronoi

This is still under heavy development and the API is not stable, so use it as inspiration for your own project but do not depend on this package directly.

The deity generation code is based on:
