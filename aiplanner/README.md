# Simple Goal Oriented Action Planning in Golang (WIP)
This is a very, very simple GOAP implementation (I think. I don't know if this qualifies as one). It's not smart, it's not efficient. Believe me, you don't want this thing planning your wedding or vacation.

The code was inspired by:
[github.com/jamiecollinson/go-goap](https://github.com/jamiecollinson/go-goap)

## Principle
Well... You set up a new planner and then you define some actions and all that and then it does some magic.

## IOU
Proper documentation whenever this is finished.
