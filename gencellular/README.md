# Simple Cellular Automata in Golang (WIP)
This package currently only implements Conway's Game of Life.

The code was inspired by:
[github.com/rafael-santiago/googol](https://github.com/rafael-santiago/googol)

## Principle
I'll write something here some day when this is done.

## IOU
Proper documentation whenever this is finished.

## Cells!
