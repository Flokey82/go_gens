# simmotive

This package is a crude port of https://github.com/alexcu/motive-simulator which is adapted from Don Hopkins' article The Soul of The Sims which shows an prototype of the 'soul' of what became The Sims 1, written January 23, 1997.

Please note that this is a pretty direct port of the original coda and could use some refactoring and cleanup.

Here, have a picture:
