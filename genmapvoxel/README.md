# genmapvoxel

This package implements a simple voxel based terrain generator. Like... really simple.

Please be aware that this is just code for experimentation and is pretty rubbish for now... It will also serve as input for the genmarchingcubes package, so I can test out how well the logic for interpolation works and whatnot.

Honestly, I don't really feel motivated to write more right now.

## Done

* binary / bool voxel terrain
* Wavefront OBJ export

## TODO

* float values for voxel data

Here, have a picture:
