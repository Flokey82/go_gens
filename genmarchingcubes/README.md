# genmarchingcubes

This package is an implementation of the marching cubes algorithm, which takes a voxel field and generates a surface mesh.

Right now it is almost a straight fork of
* https://github.com/soypat/sdf/blob/main/render/marchingcubes.go
* https://github.com/fogleman/mc/blob/master/mc.go

... but will be modified more heavily in future versions.
